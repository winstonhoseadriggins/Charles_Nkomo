	<h3> Gallery</h3>
  <p>I have been painting for a long time and mostly showing my work on Facebook - most of the paintings have been sold away, but I would like at this moment to display all my work here whether bought or still with me. Right now I will just post paintings without description, but with time I will come back to the gallery to title them. Please note that work after this date of 12/10/2015 will be titled, and the latest is displayed in the 'New Paintings Tab'
